## To Do's

0. Change default branch to `main`
1. Update transports such that logs are saved to files ‚úÖ
2. Wrap this with fast-redact (https://github.com/davidmarkclements/fast-redact) such that clients can pass keys that should be redacted
3. Why do we use morgan? I see that morgan can be integrated with winston.
4. Add tests
5. Log to console ‚úÖ
6. Send logs to cloudwatch
7. Config files that can be used by consumers to automatically configure logger to fit needs (i.e. using this logger in a raspberry pi env vs in ECS)
8. Add CODEOWNERS

## Getting Started

# See https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token to create a personal access token.
